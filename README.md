# Compiler
This repository contains a Morse code compiler implemented using Lex and Yacc, along with several optimization techniques integrated using Python. The project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for converting text into Morse code efficiently while incorporating optimizations to enhance performance and resource utilization.
Usage
Input Text: Provide the text you wish to convert into Morse code as input to the compiler.

Run Compiler: Execute the compiler to generate the Morse code output.

Optimization: Experiment with different optimization techniques by enabling or disabling them in the Python scripts.
